            <h2>Introduction to Volleyball</h2>
            <p>Volleyball is a dynamic and exciting sport that has gained immense popularity worldwide. It is played by two teams, typically consisting of six players each, who aim to score points by sending a ball over a net and into the opposing team's court.</p>
            
            <h2>The Objective of the Game</h2>
            <p>The primary objective in volleyball is to score points by grounding the ball on the opponent's side of the court. Teams can score points when the opposing team fails to return the ball, hits it out of bounds, or commits a fault.</p>
            
            <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
            <p>Each team is allowed a maximum of three successive touches of the ball to return it to the opponent's side. Players can use any part of their body to hit the ball, but they must avoid carrying or throwing it. The game is played in sets, and the first team to reach 25 points wins the set, provided they lead by at least two points.</p>
